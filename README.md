#eUptime
##About
Using Eclipse on a daily basis at work, I always have 2 or 3 instances running at the same time... And commonly, I let them run for hours...
Sadly, sometimes when an Eclipse instance is running for too long, everything starts crashing and developing becomes quite boring.

I needed a quick way to know if my Eclipse instance was running for too long, so I developed this really small widget allowing to display the Eclipse's uptime. It uses some colors to see quickly if Eclipse is running for too long.

I know it's not the most useful plugin to have in Eclipse, but at least I needed something like this, searched on the Internet and didn't find anything. So I made it, and if one day someone's searching for the same tool, maybe he won't have to do it himself :)
##License
This plugin is released under the [WTFPL License](http://www.wtfpl.net/txt/copying/)... Because seriously... it's only a few lines of code. So if you want to do anything with this... just do it.
##Documentation
Seriously?

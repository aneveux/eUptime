<h2>About</h2>

<p>Using Eclipse on a daily basis at work, I always have 2 or 3 instances running at the same time... And commonly, I let them run for hours...
Sadly, sometimes when an Eclipse instance is running for too long, everything starts crashing and developing becomes quite boring.</p>

<p>I needed a quick way to know if my Eclipse instance was running for too long, so I developed this really small widget allowing to display the Eclipse's uptime. It uses some colors to see quickly if Eclipse is running for too long.</p>

<p>I know it's not the most useful plugin to have in Eclipse, but at least I needed something like this, searched on the Internet and didn't find anything. So I made it, and if one day someone's searching for the same tool, maybe he won't have to do it himself :)</p>

<h2>License</h2>

<p>This plugin is released under the <a href="http://www.wtfpl.net/txt/copying/">WTFPL License</a>... Because seriously... it's only a few lines of code. So if you want to do anything with this... just do it.</p>

<h2>Documentation</h2>

<p>Seriously?</p>

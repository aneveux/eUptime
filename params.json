And commonly, I let them run for hours...\r\nSadly, sometimes when an Eclipse instance is running for too long, everything starts crashing and developing becomes quite boring.\r\n\r\nI needed a quick way to know if my Eclipse instance was running for too long, so I developed this really small widget allowing to display the Eclipse's uptime. It uses some colors to see quickly if Eclipse is running for too long.\r\n\r\nI know it's not the most useful plugin to have in Eclipse, but at least I needed something like this, searched on the Internet and didn't find anything. So I made it, and if one day someone's searching for the same tool, maybe he won't have to do it himself :)\r\n##License\r\nThis plugin is released under the [WTFPL License](http://www.wtfpl.net/txt/copying/)... Because seriously... it's only a few lines of code. So if you want to do anything with this... just do it.\r\n##Documentation\r\nSeriously?\r\n##Contact\r\nDon't hesitate to follow me on twitter if you liked this: [@antoineneveux](http://twitter.com/antoineneveux)!","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
